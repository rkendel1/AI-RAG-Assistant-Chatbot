# Lumina Backend (Server) 🚀

This directory contains the **server** side of the **Lumina** project – a robust backend built with **Node.js** and **Express** using **TypeScript**. The backend provides all the necessary API endpoints for user authentication, conversation management, and AI chat interactions, as well as integrations with external services like MongoDB, OpenAI, and Pinecone.

## Overview

The Lumina backend is designed to handle:

- **User Authentication:** Secure sign up, login, and password reset functionalities using JWT.
- **Conversation Management:** Endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, searching, and deleting conversations.
- **AI Chat Integration:** Processes chat queries to generate AI responses.
- **External Integrations:** Connects with MongoDB for data storage, Pinecone for vector-based searches, and external AI APIs to generate responses.

---

## Key Features

- **Secure API:** Implements robust JWT authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Conversation Handling:** Supports creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting conversations.
- **AI Chat Service:** Facilitates dynamic interactions with the AI, leveraging advanced language models.
- **External Integrations:** Seamlessly integrates with MongoDB, Pinecone, and other external services.
- **Email & Password Management:** Endpoints for email verification and password reset functionality.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** & **Express** – Server framework for handling HTTP requests and routing.
- **TypeScript** – Enhances code quality and maintainability with static typing.
- **MongoDB** (with Mongoose) – Data storage and object modeling.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** – Secure authentication mechanism.
- **Additional Libraries:** bcrypt, cors, dotenv, multer, nodemailer, openai, uuid, etc.
- **Development Tools:** nodemon and ts-node for a smooth development experience.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- **POST /api/auth/signup:** Register a new user.
- **POST /api/auth/login:** Authenticate a user and return a JWT.
- **GET /api/auth/verify-email?email=example@example.com:** Verify if an email exists.
- **POST /api/auth/reset-password:** Reset a user’s password.

### Conversations

- **POST /api/conversations:** Create a new conversation.
- **GET /api/conversations:** Retrieve all conversations for a user.
- **GET /api/conversations/:id:** Retrieve a specific conversation by its ID.
- **PUT /api/conversations/:id:** Rename or update a conversation.
- **GET /api/conversations/search/:query:** Search conversations by title or content.
- **DELETE /api/conversations/:id:** Delete a conversation.

### Chat

- **POST /api/chat:** Process a chat query and return an AI-generated response.

For additional API details, please refer to the OpenAPI specification file (`openapi.yaml`) located in the project root or visit the `/docs` endpoint on the deployed server.

## Setup & Installation

### Development Setup

1. **Navigate to the server folder:**

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables:**  
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following variables (modify as needed):

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ai-assistant
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
   GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
   AI_INSTRUCTIONS=Your system instructions for the AI assistant
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here
   PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=your_pinecone_index_name_here
   ```

4. **Run the server in development mode:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command uses `nodemon` with `ts-node` to automatically restart the server upon changes.

## Dockerization

To run the backend using Docker:

1. Ensure Docker is installed on your system.
2. From the project root, run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

This command will start the backend (and frontend if included in the Compose file) as specified in the `docker-compose.yml` configuration.

---

## Deployment

For production deployment, consider hosting services like **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **Vercel**. Ensure that you set your environment variables appropriately on your hosting platform. Also, update any necessary API endpoints in your frontend to match the production URL.
